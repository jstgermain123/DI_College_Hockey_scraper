# NCAA DI Scraper Walkthrough
#The NCAA_Team_Data_scrape function is used to scrape a season of data from College Hockey News aggregated website of existing college hockey data from 2005-present. A data frame of the requested data is returned from the function. Currently only a single season may be selected at a time. In the future, the goal is to be able to select multiple seasons or individual teams. 


#Season:
#• A string representing a full season
#   •	  example: "20182019""
