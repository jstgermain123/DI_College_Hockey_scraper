## NCAA DI Scraper Walkthrough

### NCAA_TD_scrape 
The NCAA_TD_scrape function is used to scrape a season of data from the College Hockey News aggregated website of existing college hockey data from 2005-present. A data frame of the requested data is returned from the function. Currently only a single season may be selected at a time. In the future, the goal is to be able to select multiple seasons or individual teams. 

### NCAA_PD_scrape
The NCAA_PD_scrape function is used to scrape player data for specific season of data from the College Hockey News website (years 2005-present). A data frame of the requested data is returned from the function. Currently only a single season may be selected at a time. In the future, the goal is to be able to select multiple seasons or individual players. 

### NCAA_AS_Calculations
The NCAA_AS_Calculations function is used to calculate advanced player statistics, specifically offensive & defensive point shares. More information on point shares can be found here (https://www.hockey-reference.com/about/point_shares.html). The input to this function is the same - a single string representing the season. This function works in conjunction with the other two scraper functions. Please note that the player data scraper and the team data scraper must be run prior to running this function.
